      <p><em>"I am always doing that which I can not do, in order that I may learn how to do it."</em> <br /> - Pablo Picasso</p>

      <p>I have spent most of my life studying fine art and only a few months studying web development; however, my studies of art have helped me realize my greatest passion in life is learning. I was drawn to web development, because the field, maybe moreso than any other, drives the developer to constantly learn, explore, and solve problems. Although my portfolio is small, I am eager to continue to learn and make beautiful, efficient things. I believe the seemingly unrelated skills I've learned throughout life are not so unrelated, and I hope to connect my past experiences and observations with my new work.  </p>
